# 💰 Employee Salary Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts employee salaries based on multiple factors including years of experience, department, age, and performance scores. Built during my internship to demonstrate data science and web development skills.

## 🎯 Overview

This project includes:
- **Data Generation**: Created a synthetic dataset of 200,000 employee records
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis with visualizations  
- **Model Training**: Linear regression model for salary prediction
- **Web App**: Interactive Streamlit application

## ✨ Features

- Realistic employee dataset with multiple departments
- Interactive web interface for salary predictions
- Data visualizations and analysis
- Model trained on multiple features: years of experience, department, age, and performance scores

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - Programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy** - Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Streamlit** - Web application
- **Faker** - Synthetic data generation

## 📊 Dataset

Synthetic dataset with 200,000 employee records including:
- Age, Gender, Department, Role
- Years of Experience (0-35 years)
- Performance Score (1-5 rating)
- Current Salary (₹2.5L - ₹40L range)

## � Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kbis0/Salary-Prediction.git
   cd Salary-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **View the analysis**
   - Open `Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to see the complete data analysis and model training process

## 📈 Results

- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Features**: Years of Experience, Department, Age, Performance Score  
- **Accuracy**: Mean Absolute Error ~₹6.71L
- **Dataset**: 159,995 training samples, 39,999 testing samples (80-20 split)
